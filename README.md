> Have you ever had trouble finding the right tool for the job? Outdated syllabus reccommending less than optimal IDEs? Have technical issues that no one in your section knows how to solve?

ToolMate is a tool created for UTD students attending ECS related classes for Computer Science and Software Engineering. It allows students to view, rank, submit, and comment about software tools for classes at UTD. Never again will students be stuck using Eclipse for weeks before their friend tells them about IntelliJ, or be unable to run their code due to software issues. 

Our core issue with existing solutions like a Discord server is that many times, it is too easy for someone to miss the invitation link at the beginning of the semester. In addition, having all knowledge from previous semesters or even other sections of a course be lost or unaccessable for current students creates the need to "reinvent the wheel" for every section. Questions that have been solved, must be solved again every year. Another issue we wanted to tackle is the issue of the barrier that is imposed when someone needs help. We wanted to give the more introverted students a way to post their questions and answers with 100% anonymity. One of our team members specfically has the problem of where they will see a questions that they know the solution to, but hesitate to answer in fear of seeming like a know it all or being wrong. With this system, it is a lot easier to someone to answer or ask questions without fear of being judged.
